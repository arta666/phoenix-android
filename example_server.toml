# Phoenix Server Configuration Example
# This configuration file controls the behavior of the Phoenix server.

# listen_addr: The TCP address and port the server will bind to.
# Default: ":8080" (for h2c) or ":8443" (for mTLS)
listen_addr = ":8080"

# [security]: This section defines which tunneling protocols are permitted
# and handles authentication via mTLS keys.
[security]
# auth_token: Shared secret for client authentication.
# If set, only clients with this exact token can connect.
# Works with all TLS modes (h2c, system, mTLS).
# auth_token = "your-secret-token-here"

# enable_socks5: Allow clients to tunnel SOCKS5 traffic.
enable_socks5 = true

# enable_udp: Allow SOCKS5 UDP Associate (for UDP tunneling).
enable_udp = true

# enable_shadowsocks: Allow clients to tunnel Shadowsocks traffic.
enable_shadowsocks = false

# enable_ssh: Allow clients to tunnel SSH traffic.
enable_ssh = false

# --- Secure Authentication (mTLS) ---
# To enable secure mode, generate keys with `./server -gen-keys`
# and set the path to your Private Key below.
# private_key = "server.private.key"

# List of Authorized Client Public Keys (Base64).
# Only clients with these keys can connect (mTLS).
# If this list is empty or commented out, the server operates in One-Way TLS mode.
# In One-Way TLS, any client can connect securely (HTTPS-like), but no client authentication is performed.
# authorized_clients = [
#   "CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY_1...",
#   "CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY_2..."
# ]
